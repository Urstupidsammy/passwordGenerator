Title: Password Generator

Description :
This week I created a password Generator that you can use to create a unique based around the criteria that you choose to add. The generator requires you to maintain the length between 8 and 128 characters. Also has a prompt that asks the user whether they would like to add uppercase, lowecase, symbols, or numbers to your password.
